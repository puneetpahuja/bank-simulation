# Parking Lot

## Build tool

### Stack

Stack is a build and package manager for Haskell.

It can be installed from [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install).

**Note**: There is a `shell.nix` file also if you want to use `nix` as the package manager and `cabal` as the build tool.
